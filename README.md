# Password-Generator
A website that can generate random passwords.

## What was the motivation?

To help develop my skills at utilising JavaScript. I wanted to make a random password generator to test my skills in creating and using variables, 
if statements, and for loops. 

## What problems does it solve?

Passwords can be a tricky thing to think up of on the spot, or even if given a lot of thought. And even if someone has thought up of a password, it may be
easy for someone to guess, or to figure it out through the process of elimination. Password generators solve both these issues, since they can instantly
create a secure password that is impossible to guess. This generator I've created will even let the user create their password with certain criteria in
mind, like if they'd like to include numbers or uppercase letters, or exlude to them.

## What did you learn?

Here is a list of what I've learnt from making this random password generator:
>
>- How to use if statements to check if a boolean is true or false, and what consequences follow, such as running a function.
>- Storing arrays in variables so that they can be chosen at random later.
>- Using the concat method to combine any arrays that were selected in the criteria by the user.
>- Using an if statement to check if the user said no to all criteria, making it impossible to create a password. They need to select at least one.
>- Using a for loop to go through an index, by the amount of times as there are characters to be in the password.
>- Using functions to let the user decide on what characters they want in their password, filling out their criteria.
